#This is a bar graph that has a title of Sentiments Of Tweets Per day the Y axis has the values from 0 to 4000 and reflects the count of tweets and the X axis has the date of when these sentiments were posted. There are 3 bars that represent the sentiments, the legends of the sentiments are: red = negative, orange = neutral, blue = positive.

#Most of the sentiments of tweets are negative and the highest number of negative sentiments are on July 15, 2020

#This data is a sentiment analysis and it shows that most of the tweets in twitter are negative.
